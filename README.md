# Energy Management, Scheduling and Monitoring in a Smart Grid
In this project, we develop a system to schedule electric power among different nodes in a smart grid, aiming to reduce the energy usage of conventional sources (coal) and promote renewable sources (solar and wind). The system leverages the bi-directionality of smart grids over conventional grids. We provide households with a monitoring strategy to further reduce coal consumption.

The system is designed for future use, requiring machine learning-based prediction techniques. For time-series supply data, we use an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model to achieve an average accuracy of 91%. These predictions, along with household demand, are fed to the grid controller, which develops the best scheduling strategy to minimize coal usage. The scheduling result, including source-specific usage and household appliance usage, is then fed into a monitoring strategy that recommends appliance usage to effectively reduce conventional energy consumption. The result is an energy management system that schedules energy based on predictions.
